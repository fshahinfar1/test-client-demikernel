- DPDK is installed globally (version: 23.11)

- These environment variables are set:
	CLIENT_IPV4_ADDR=192.168.1.2:50123
	NET_IFACE=ens1f1np1
	WORKDIR=/users/farbod/demi
	CONFIG_PATH=/users/farbod/demi/config.yaml
	SERVER_IPV4_ADDR=192.168.1.1:8080
	LIBOS=catnap

- Only the DPDK(catnip) LIBOS was compiled so it is possible that other modes
  do not work. I have included the library in this repository. The library was
  built on a x86_64 little endian cpu.


- The following command should make it run

```
make
./build/tcp-ping-pong.elf --client 192.168.1.1 8080
```
